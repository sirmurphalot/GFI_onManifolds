Overview
========

Code implementations of the models discussed in *Generalized Fiducial Inverence on Differentiable Manifolds* by A. Murph, J. Hannig, and J. Williams.


This repository is organized into four different directories; two using [Brubaker et al's Constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbrubake/projects/cmcmc/) method and two using [Zappa et al's Constrained Metropolis-Hastings](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.21783) algorithm.
Each directory contains a Matlab notebook that walks through the examples step-by-step.  This will hopefully help any potential user looking for mastery.
